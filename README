Provided with an smb:// link to a Samba resource (host, folder, or file), this script automounts all the public Samba 
shares on the matching host, and opens the correspoding full path to the resource in your favourite file manager $FM; 
after you're done with browsing the resource or using it (no need to download anything any more!:), close the $FM,
and the script will automatically unmount everything pertaining to this resource and remove the correspoding 
folders in $MOUNT_ROOT.

Usage: smbopen smb://path, where 'path' is 'host[/]', 'host/share[/]', 'host/share/file_or_folder[/]' etc.
You can use the script as an smb:// protocol handler in Firefox, Opera (using xdg-open) etc. 
It understands non-ASCII symbols in links, as well as %XX-encoding.

Caveat: Currently you may use only those FMs that don't detach from the script while being launched.
